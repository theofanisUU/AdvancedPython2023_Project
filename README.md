# AdvancedPython2023_Project
Project for  Advanced Scientific Programming with Python (3hp)

Description: Building, optimising and documenting a script for analysis
of spectra obtained from optical transmition experiments. 
Data are stored in txt files,each containing 2 columns (wavelength,intensity)

The code opens and reads those files, stores the contents and selectively
produces useful plots from them, based on user input.

Contents:
functionsForOpticalData.py : Contains useful Functions and their documentation
mainOpticalAnalysis        : Contains the user input(for now hardcoded)and runs the functions of the other module
