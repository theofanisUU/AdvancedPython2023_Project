# AdvancedPython2023_Project
Project for  Advanced Scientific Programming with Python (3hp)

Description: Building, optimising and documenting a script for analysis
of spectra obtained from optical transmition experiments. 
Data are stored in txt files,each containing 2 columns (wavelength,intensity)

The code needs to open and read those files, store the contents and extract information
and some useful plots from them.
